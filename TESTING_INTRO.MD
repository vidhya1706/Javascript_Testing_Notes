# What is testing?

Testing is about verifying whether something works as expected. And when building websites/software, we expect all the features to work as expected.

There are two types of testing

1. Manual Testing
2. Automated Testing

## Manual Testing:

It is about verifying the feature manually post-development without any scripts/test cases. Once we complete the feature, we have to test not only the feature that we worked on, we have to test the entire flow. If something breaks, that will cause a problem. Additionally, there is a chance to forget to test a certain part of the website and it's not guaranteed that you always test everything.

And that's where automated testing comes into play.

## Automated Testing:

With automated testing, the idea is that you write some code that tests your code. Whenever you added a new feature, this code will run a predefined list of tests that test various aspects of your site automatically. Of course, this requires some initial effort but after writing the testing code initially, you have no effort. With automated tests, it's easier to test all kinds of different scenarios.

Automated testing is something we should strongly consider adding to your projects. It's not a replacement for manual testing.

Manual testing is important, especially when you are working on a large project. But you should not only do manual testing, you should also add automated tests to your projects.
